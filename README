TunnelTasks, for lack of a better name, is being built with the intent to provide some form of one (or few) click staging and production deployment in a  LAMP (PHP) environment. Right now the specific focus is towards the management of WordPress sites.

## General Warning

This stuff definitely goes around plenty of security principles. If it's not entirely obvious, use at your own risk.

## Requirements

Nothing solid yet, but...
* You'll want at least 2 servers setup to test - one for production, one for staging.
* PHP's Secure Shell2 (http://php.net/manual/en/book.ssh2.php) is required. So far no replacement on a Windows box.
